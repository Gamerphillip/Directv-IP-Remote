Veraion 1.0.0 - 05/05/2016

## This is not a _stable_ list of files. Im using this a staging area for files that Im working on.
---
* **/Proof of concept** - is a groovy (Smartthings) file that Im working on that will auto discover
DirectTV IP bases set top boxes.
* **/Icons** - just a logo to use with the Smartthings App
* **/devicetypes** - Smartthings device type groovy file
* **/smartapps** - Smartthings Connect and child app

> Im creating this app so I can automatically create virtual device buttons that can be used with Amazon Echo to change the stations on the directv box. The idea is you can add a button that is called TV NBC and when telling Alexa to "turn on TV NBC" the station will change to NBC.

> After all your stations have been added you will need to give access to the newly created buttons in the Alexa smart app and then issue a "Discover new devices" command to Alexa
